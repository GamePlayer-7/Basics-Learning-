We will see one example below.

A = 'Hello"       # Assigning to A
A                 # Call A
'Hello"           # Prints Output with Quotes.    

print(A)          # Calls A using print
Hello             # Prints Output without Quotes.

NOTE : Difference of writing A & print(A) is Quotes will get dissappear using print.
