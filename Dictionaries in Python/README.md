Dictionaries in Python :

* Dictionaries work as key value pairs just like hash table.
* Instead of holding elements through sequence it hold it through keys.
* Hence Dictionaries have no concept of order among elements.
* Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces { } and values are assigned using square braces [].
